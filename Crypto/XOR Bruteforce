XOR brute force is a method used to decrypt data that has been encrypted using the XOR (exclusive OR) cipher, especially when the encryption key is unknown. 
The XOR cipher is a simple symmetric encryption technique where each byte of the plaintext is combined with a byte of the key using the XOR operation to produce the ciphertext. 
Due to its simplicity, the XOR cipher is vulnerable to brute force attacks, making XOR brute force a common technique in cryptanalysis and Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions.

XOR Operation: The XOR (^) operation compares two bits and returns 1 if they are different and 0 if they are the same.
