The Network Log

Each row of the Network Log represents a resource. By default the resources are listed chronologically. The top resource is usually the main HTML document. The bottom resource is whatever was requested last.

Each column represents information about a resource. Figure 6 shows the default columns:

Status. The HTTP response code.
Type. The resource type.
Initiator. What caused a resource to be requested. Clicking a link in the Initiator column takes you to the source code that caused the request.
Time. How long the request took.
Waterfall. A graphical representation of the different stages of the request. Hover over a Waterfall to see a breakdown.
