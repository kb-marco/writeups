A Directory Traversal Attack is a security vulnerability that allows attackers to access files and directories stored outside the intended web root folder.
By manipulating input fields such as URLs or form inputs, attackers use sequences like ../ (which means "go up one directory") to traverse the file system.
This attack can expose sensitive files (e.g., configuration files, passwords, logs) that the web server has access to but should be restricted from public view. 
Properly sanitizing and validating user inputs, and restricting file system access, are key ways to prevent this vulnerability.
