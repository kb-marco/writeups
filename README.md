# Welcome to My CTF Write-ups Collection!

Thank you for visiting my collection of Capture the Flag (CTF) write-ups. 
This repository showcases my journey through various CTF challenges, where I tackle cybersecurity puzzles, reverse engineere programs, exploit vulnerabilities, and more. 
My goal is to break down each challenge, explain my thought process, and share the tools and techniques that led to solving them.

## Why CTF?

Participating in CTFs allows me to continuously improve my skills in networking, cybersecurity, reverse engineering, and cryptography.
I enjoy solving complex problems and learning new concepts with each challenge.
It's a great way to apply theoretical knowledge in practical scenarios and collaborate with other cybersecurity enthusiasts.

## Tools and Technologies

During these challenges, I use a variety of tools, including:

- Wireshark
- Nmap
- Metasploit
- Python
- Bash
- Hexcurse
